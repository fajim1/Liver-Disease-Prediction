# Liver-Disease-Prediction
Patients with Liver disease have been continuously increasing because of excessive consumption of alcohol, inhale of harmful gases, intake of contaminated food, drugs, etc. This dataset was used to construct, evaluate and tune different models in order to predict patients with liver disease in an effort to reduce burden on doctors


# Motivation
This project was performed as part of a group for my Artificial Intelligence course during my undergrad. The requirement for this project was to find a sizeable dataset and perform Pre-processing, EDA and predictive modeling. 

Patients with Liver disease have been continuously increasing because of excessive consumption of alcohol, inhale of harmful gases, intake of contaminated food, pickles and drugs. This dataset was used to evaluate prediction algorithms in an effort to reduce burden on doctors

# Data Source

This dataset was downloaded from the UCI ML Repository:

Lichman, M. (2013). UCI Machine Learning Repository [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml]. Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science.

# Using the Files
The .csv file shows the raw data used for the project. 
The .Rmd file shows all the code and write-up. This file can be downloaded and knitted to get the final output.
The .html file is the knitted R-Markdown file. The rendered file can be found at https://fajim1.github.io/Movies-Analysis/
The .ppt file contains my groups presentation slides for this project.
